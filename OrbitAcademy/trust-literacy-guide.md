## Trust Score Basics
- Starts at 50 for new contributors
- Ranges 0–100, visible across modules
- Impacts badge visibility and module access

|-------------------------|--------------|
| On-time delivery        | +5           |
| Verified learning       | +3           |
| Complaint filed         | -4           |
| Violation (spam, fraud) | -8 to -15    |

## Violation Types
- **Minor**: Delayed messages, soft spam — warn & score penalty
- **Moderate**: Missed pickup, unverified post — flag & review
