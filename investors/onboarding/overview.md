## Contributor Lifecycle

OrbitVerse welcomes open participation—with integrity at the core.

### Stages:
1. **Newcomer** — Joins via open onboarding
2.  **Verified Contributor** — Completes ecosystem training, begins tracking via OrbitTrust
3.  **Trusted Builder** — Gains trust badges after multiple verified actions
4.  **Moderator / Auditor** — Participates in governance, reviews flagged activity

Badges, identity proofs, and trust scores flow between OrbitSecureAI and OrbitTrust—and governance decisions are captured in OrbitGovern.
