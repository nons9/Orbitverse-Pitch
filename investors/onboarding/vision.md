## OrbitVerse: Building the Trust Layer for African Logistics

Our vision is ambitious, yet grounded:

- OrbitVerse aims to be Africa’s trust-first logistics ecosystem—modular, transparent, and open-source.
- We believe every shipment, contributor, and community deserves accountability by default.
- By 2030, OrbitVerse will serve as a blueprint for global decentralized logistics governance—starting from Africa, scaling worldwide.

This is more than software it’s infrastructure, legacy, and community.
