OrbitEvents powers live experiences across the OrbitVerse ecosystem. From trade expos to verified launch campaigns, every event is **score-aware**, **moderation-gated**, and impact-tracked.

## Core Features
- **Contributor-Created Events**: Verified members initiate expos and lounges
- **Score-Based Access**: Visibility and perks gated via OrbitTrust
- **Moderation Hooks**: Identity, spam, and fraud prevention (`eventAuth-hooks.json`)
- **Impact Feeds**: Score flow triggered by attendee feedback and event actions (`event-impact-feed.md`)
- **Partner Alignment**: Events can be audited, scored, and boosted based on verified integrations

## ðŸ”— OrbitTrust Integration
OrbitEvents interfaces with OrbitSecureAI and OrbitAcademy to:
- Verify host credentials and badge levels
- Log attendee score changes based on feedback and actions
- Trigger onboarding for first-time contributors during expos
