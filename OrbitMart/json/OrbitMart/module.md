# OrbitMart Fraud Protection Module

This document outlines the fraud logic, TrustScore integration plans, and API hooks embedded into OrbitMartâ€™s seller verification and transaction ecosystem.

---

## Fraud Detection Logic

Using `fraud-protection-flow.json`, the module implements:

- **Pattern Matching: Flags duplicate listings, sudden price spikes, or excessive returns.
- **TrustScore Triggering: ** Applies stricter verifications for low-rated sellers.
- **Behavior Analysis: Tracks seller consistency across delivery times, geo-location, and customer reviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ TrustScore Strategy

OrbitMart will maintain a dynamic seller TrustScore based on:

| Metric                | Weight | Source                    |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Delivery Timeliness   | 25%    | Orbit Logistics API       |
| Customer Feedback     | 30%    | Marketplace Review System |
| Refund Ratio          | 15%    | CMS Order Logs            |
| Identity Verification | 20%    | Onboarding Module         |
| API Usage Compliance | 10%    | Developer Logs            |

Thresholds may evolve based on fraud patterns and market feedback.
