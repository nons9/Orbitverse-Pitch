# OrbitDeliver: Courier Routing & Verification Logic

This module defines the smart logistics logic powering regional delivery, GPS routing, and verified courier onboarding.

---

## Core Routing Logic

OrbitDeliver uses an AI-powered dispatcher with fallback rules:

- **GPS optimization:** Dynamic routing based on traffic, zones, and delivery priority.
- **Fallback tiers:** Offline route caching in areas with poor signal.
- **Status loops:** Time-stamped updates (pickup, handoff, delivery confirmation).

| Successful Deliveries  | 40%    | OrbitMart Logs            |
