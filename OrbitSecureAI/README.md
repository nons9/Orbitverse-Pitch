# OrbitSecureAI Module Overview

OrbitSecureAI is the trust and moderation backbone of the OrbitVerse superapp. It governs contributor behavior, enforces identity protocols, tracks violations, and preserves trust across delivery, trade, finance, and communication flows.

## Purpose

OrbitSecureAI provides:
- Real-time fraud monitoring and contributor scoring (`TrustScore`)
- Event-triggered moderation across modules
- Role-based visibility into violations and recovery paths
- Transparent audits for all flagged identities and actions

Whether you're a courier, trader, finance partner, or admin, this module ensures fairness, accountability, and data-backed trust.

## Structure

## Core Concepts

- **Event Triggers:** Each division (Deliver, Trade, Finance, Connect) sends events here (e.g., failed escrow, identity mismatch, courier no-show).
- **TrustScore Engine:** Weights contributor behavior over time using signals from all modules.
- **Moderation Flow:** Flag → Score → Role visibility → Identity lock or recovery.
- **Audit Logs:** Every moderation event is logged and can be reviewed for contributor transparency.

## Examples

| Event | Triggering Module | TrustScore Impact | Possible Outcome |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Escrow mismatch | OrbitTrade | -15 | Admin review |
| Fake ID upload | OrbitConnect | -40 | Immediate lock |
| Late delivery | OrbitDeliver | -5 | Warning |
| Loan default | OrbitFinance | -25 | Credit lock |

## Interoperability

OrbitSecure is designed to plug into:
- `role-access-rules.json`: defines who sees what
- `notification-triggers.json`: alerts key admins
- `trustConfig.json`: scoring weights per module

## Contributor Note

Moderation logic is open-source, auditable, and adaptive. We welcome contributors who want to refine rules, improve scoring fairness, and build Africa’s most trusted tech ecosystem.
